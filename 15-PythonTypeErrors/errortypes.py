"""PYTHON ERROR TYPES"""
# When coding it is common that we make typo's or some other common error.
"""If our code fails to run, the Python interpreter 
will display a message, containing feedback with information on where the problem occurs and the type of an error. 
It will also sometimes gives us suggestions on a possible fix. Understanding different types of errors in 
programming languages will help us to debug our code quickly and also it makes us better at what we do.
